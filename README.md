### Mission to Mars Web Scraping

We were able to scrape data to output the latest Mars news, a featured Mars image, and Mars facts. We updated our web app to also scrape high-resolution Mars Hemisphere images and titles. Finally we added Bootstrap 3 componenets to make our site stand out. Note the "Scrape New Data" button that will update the site with the latest Mars data upon being clicked.
